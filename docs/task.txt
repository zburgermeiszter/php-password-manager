Password Manager

The Brief

We would like you to create a small application for users to manage their passwords.

This application must be written using PHP and MySQL.

Requirements

1) A user should be able to authenticate
a) Login, and
b) Logout
2) A logged in user should be able to:
a) Create a new entry
b) See a list of all their individual entries
c) View and update their entry
d) Delete their individual entries

Deliverables

Provide all files required by your application in order for it to work.
Include a README file with setup and configuration instructions.

Notes
Please donâ€™t use any 3rd-party PHP libraries/frameworks
JavaScript libraries/frameworks like jQuery are fine
