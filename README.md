# Password Manager

## The Brief

We would like you to create a small application for users to manage their passwords.

This application must be written using PHP and MySQL.

## Requirements

1. A user should be able to authenticate
  * Login
  * Logout
2. A logged in user should be able to
  * Create a new entry
  * See a list of all their individual entries
  * View and update their entry
  * Delete their individual entries

## Deliverables

Provide all files required by your application in order for it to work.  
Include a README file with setup and configuration instructions.

## Notes
Please donâ€™t use any 3rd-party PHP libraries/frameworks.  
JavaScript libraries/frameworks like jQuery are fine.
